# Python Interests

I already have a lot of experience with Python because I taught myself after taking a class in Java, and it has been my preferred language since. The first two interests I’m including are some of my favorite things about Python. The third interest is something I want to explore in the future. All of these can be found on the Python website. 

## Django

Django is my favorite Python framework for building websites. It lets you build websites quickly, has great documentation, and a large online community. My favorite thing about Django is that it's server-side rendered and makes use of default class-based views, which are highly extensible. My second and third favorite things are its documentation and online community (this is my favorite thing about programming in general). Django's documentation has a lot of information and even includes a tutorial to help get started. The answer to most issues can usually be found in the documentation. If you can’t find it there, there are many forums where you can ask or answer questions or view questions similar to your issue.

One downside of Django is that it isn’t easy to work with when building an API. For an API, I would use Flask or FastAPI.

The link for Django's website can be found on Python's applications page under the section about different web frameworks.

## Speed, Easy to Use, and Powerful

I'm including the About page because the quote at the very top says exactly why I like Python. It's very fast, easy to work with, and has a wide range of uses. I like how it's dynamically typed and uses indentation instead of braces.

## GUIs

This mainly caught my attention because I want to learn more about Python GUI toolkits. I've used Tkinter for a simple calculator app, but I want to try others and see which one I like the best. I don't have a lot of experience with building desktop GUIs, so learning some of the toolkits would give me a little more insight as to how they work and how concepts can be transferred to other languages.

The Python applications page has a list of different GUI toolkits under the section about desktop GUIs.
